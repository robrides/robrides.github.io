    <p>Have you ever thought, "It's time for a career reboot"? When your hard
      work, deep insight, and self motivation is ignored by those in positions
      with the ability to make a positive change in direction. In environments
      with multiple, disjointed, orgainizations married by finances and
      capabilities yet in execution won't stop to think deeply toward a more
      cohesive, efficient, and productive direction. When your innovation is
      stiffled by mentalities perpetuating <em>'the machine'</em> and your
      attempt to move into a position to drive these changes is rewarded by
      your venerable curriculum vitae being dismissed. Now it seems like
      Groundhog Day and phrases such as <em>'toxic work environment'</em> seem
      fitting, it just might be that time. But how, you say?
      Just press enter to reboot!</p>



    <blockquote>
      <h4>"...shift your focus..."</h4>
    </blockquote>

    <p>You may be thinking, it's not quite that easy, but when these thoughts
      start flowing through your mind, stop and think - there may be a better
      approach to your day-to-day. You see the challenges, you've devloped ideas
      for overcoming them but your input falls on deaf ears - maybe you're
      working on the wrong problem. Take a step back. Pull yourself out of that
      immersion and shift your focus to something over which you have complete
      control - your own destiny. Just press enter to reboot!</p>

        alt="Two to go"></a><h4>...two to go!!</h4>
    </div>

    <p>In your mind you're on the verge.  It's like there's two to go and the
    time for decision is now!  Remove the skepticism. Overcome the fear of the
    unknown. Tust in your abilities. You can do this... Just press enter to
    reboot!</p>

    <blockquote>
      <h4>"...your future is rising"</h4>

    <p>Just press enter to reboot and change your career direction. Find a new lease
      on life and know your future is rising.  This is what I've decided to do.
      You can come with me on my jouney. Are you ready? I know am!  Here we
      go...</p>
